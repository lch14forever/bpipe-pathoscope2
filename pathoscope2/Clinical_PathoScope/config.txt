# To use the preloaded databases please enter human, bacteria, virus
#	For Example:

# For custom databases please enter the entire file path of the bowtie2 index

# ALIGNING 16S SEQUENCES: YES or NO
# Default: NO

# MODIFIABLE ALIGNMENT PARAMETERS
# Adjusts the Bowtie2 -k flag parameter
# Must be an integer value
# Default: 10, for 16S: 1,000

#Indicates the the format of the quality scores in the .fastq input file
#Please pick one, (Default: --phred33)
#From the Bowtie2 manual:
#--phred33		Input qualities are ASCII chars equal to the Phred quality plus 33. This is also called the "Phred+33" encoding, which is used by the very latest Illumina pipelines.
#--phred64		Input qualities are ASCII chars equal to the Phred quality plus 64. This is also called the "Phred+64" encoding.
#--solexa-quals	Convert input qualities from Solexa (which can be negative) toPhred (which can't). This scheme was used in older Illumina GA Pipeline versions (prior to 1.3).
#--int-quals		Quality values are represented in the read input file as space-separated ASCII integers, e.g., 40 40 30 40..., Integers are treated as being on the Phred quality scale unless --solexa-quals is also specified.
